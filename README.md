> A dynamic LinkedIn feed interface, where users can authenticate and make posts, they can also delete their own posts. Modals and a Toggle Theme with smooth animations were created with Framer Motion. With the next-themes library and TailwindCSS we can manage the application theme with the `dark` variant and with the `useTheme` hook switch between themes. Using the News API, it was possible to implement real-time news of the main news in Brazil.
